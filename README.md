# Grand Central Format #

This repository contains some simple scripts meant to help with clang-format implementation for teams. Once big issue this project set out to solve is keeping formatting consistent across the whole team when different development machines/platforms may have different clang-format configurations or versions.

Centralizing formatting requests creates a single source of formatting truth, which helps to ensure consistency.
